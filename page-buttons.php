<!-- 
    This page template has been created as a unique identifier for the text used in buttons, links, etc. This
    Fetching a page that has been assigned to this template page will fetch the page id with all the 
    custom text fields containing the text of buttons (e.g. "read more", "get tickets" etc). 
    This was done in an effort to simplify the translation of button texts.
